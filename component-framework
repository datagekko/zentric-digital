# Component Framework

The landing page follows a structured conversion framework with the following components:

## Section Components
- **HeroSection** - Main value proposition and CTA
  - Maintains full screen height with responsive layout
  - Features an animated performance dashboard with key metrics
  - Uses progressive disclosure with main message up front and supporting metrics in the dashboard
  - Dashboard includes progress bar animation and three KPI cards (ROAS improvement, CPA reduction, Email revenue boost)
  - Supporting caption positioned below dashboard for clean separation of elements
- **PasSlab** - Problem-Agitation-Solution framework
- **OfferStack** - Service tiers and pricing
- **ProofWall** - Testimonials and case studies
- **ProcessTimeline** - Client workflow visualization
- **ComparisonSection** - Contrasting with traditional agencies
- **RiskReversal** - Guarantee section
- **FinalCta** - Final conversion call-to-action
- **Footer** - Contact information and links

## Implementation Notes
- All components use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Components should follow brand guidelines for colors and typography
- Optimize for mobile responsiveness
- Add appropriate animations and transitions
  - Use subtle animations like progress bars to draw attention to key metrics
  - Avoid excessive animation that distracts from the core message
- Button text should use whitespace-nowrap to prevent text wrapping on smaller screens
- Keep primary content above the fold when possible

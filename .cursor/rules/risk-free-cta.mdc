# Risk-Free CTA

This section combines our guarantee with a direct invitation to book a discovery call. Follow these points when implementing or modifying the component:

## Guarantee Card
* Summarise the **30â€‘day no-results, no-fee** promise
* List key benefits with checkmark icons
* Use a subtle glass background (`bg-white/10` with `backdrop-blur-sm`)

## CTA Card
* Headline invites the visitor to "Scale Your Brand Profitably"
* Emphasise limited availability using `spotsLeft` state
* Button triggers `openLeadForm` from the context
* Provide a small reassurance line beneath the button about response time

## Design Notes
* Section background is a gradient from **Iris Purple** to **Deep Navy**
* Use matching rounded corners and borders across both cards
* Ensure text remains readable over the gradient (AA contrast)

### Stack & Team

| Layer | What You Get | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Founder‑Level Strategists** | Senior operators run growth end‑to‑end — no account‑manager hand‑offs. | Precision, zero “agency theatre.” |
| **AI Agents (Creative Engine)** | LLM‑powered copy + Midjourney/Figma pipeline for rapid ad variants. | Idea‑to‑live in < 48 h. |
| **First‑Party Dashboard** | Real‑time spend ↔ revenue, ROAS, MER — pulled from your own GA4/Shopify data. | Full transparency; we never touch ad funds. |


## 2 | Progressive Revenue‑Share Pricing\*

| Net‑Monthly Revenue Band | Standard Retainer | Rev‑Share on Incremental Revenue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| €0 – €50 k | €3 000 | 10 % |
| €50 k – €150 k | €4 500 | 8 % |
| €150 k – €300 k | €6 000 | 6 % |
| > €300 k | €8 000 | 4 % |

\*Bands lock at contract sign and re‑tier quarterly. Ad spend runs on the client’s own card.

### 💡 Starter “Momentum Boost” (for brands ≤ €50 k/mo)

| Variant | Month‑1–3 Cash Outlay | Rev‑Share From Month 4 Onward |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A — Discounted Retainer** | €1 500 retainer (50 % off) | 10 % |
|  |  | **Standard €3 000 + 10 %** |
| **B — Performance Ramp** | €0 retainer | 20 % rev‑share (locked for first three months) |
|  |  | **Standard €3 000 + 10 %** |

Either path lets emerging brands start with minimal cash — and pay future fees from the revenue we generate. No setup fee, ever.

## 8 | Client‑Facing Messaging Snippet

> **Precision • Momentum • Motion**  
> We send calibrated waves of high‑intent traffic — then make sure every click converts. No bloated teams, no long‑winded decks. Just clear metrics, fast loops, and senior operators you can text.  
> **If we don’t lift your blended ROAS in 60 days, you stop paying until we do.**

## 9 | Draft Off‑Ramp & Asset‑Ownership Clause

**Asset Ownership & Exit Rights**  
All ad accounts, pixels, audiences, creatives, and CRO assets are provisioned under your Business Manager from Day 0. If you exit after the initial 90‑day term, simply give 15 days’ written notice. We will:

- Transfer any remaining draft creatives and copy docs.  
- Ensure ad accounts remain uninterrupted and billing continues on your payment method.  
- Provide a final data export (CSV/Looker Studio) of campaigns and CRO test logs.

No additional fees, mark‑ups, or claw‑backs apply. **Your assets are yours — full stop.**

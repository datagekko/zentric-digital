# Development Workflow

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Access the site at http://localhost:3000

## Component Development
1. Create new components in the appropriate directory:
   - Section components in [app/components/sections/](mdc:app/components/sections)
   - UI components in [app/components/ui/](mdc:app/components/ui)
2. Follow existing component patterns and naming conventions
3. Use Tailwind CSS for styling
4. Import and use in [app/page.tsx](mdc:app/page.tsx)

## Common Issues
- If you see a CSS error about `duration-120` class, ensure you're using standard Tailwind duration classes (e.g., `duration-100`, `duration-200`)
- Use standard Tailwind utilities instead of custom classes like `backdrop-blur-glass`
- Ensure proper quoting in component props
- Set metadata.metadataBase for proper Open Graph and Twitter images

## Optimization Guidelines
- Optimize images before adding to the project
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders in components
- Use Next.js Image component for image optimization
- Follow React best practices for component composition

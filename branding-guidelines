# Branding Guidelines

## Brand Colors
Zentric Digital's brand colors are defined in [tailwind.config.js](mdc:tailwind.config.js):

- **iris-purple** - Primary brand color
- **mint-green** - Secondary brand color
- **nordic-ivory** - Background color
- **rich-black** - Text color

## Typography
- Use appropriate heading sizes (h1, h2, h3) with consistent styling
- Maintain proper spacing between text elements
- Ensure readability across all device sizes

## Design Elements
- Use subtle animations for interactive elements
- Maintain consistent padding and margins
- Ensure all CTAs follow the same design pattern
- Use appropriate imagery that matches the brand aesthetic

## Data Visualization & Metrics
- Use mint-green for positive metrics and KPIs to draw attention
- Present KPIs with clear hierarchy: bold, larger numbers with smaller explanatory text
- Progress bars should use the brand gradient (iris-purple to mint-green)
- Dashboard elements should use deep-navy background with subtle gradients
- Maintain consistent spacing between dashboard elements

## Hero Section Design
- Hero sections should fit within the viewport height (use h-screen)
- Main headlines should use the brand gradient for emphasis on key phrases
- CTAs should have whitespace-nowrap to prevent wrapping
- Keep vertical spacing compact but readable (use space-y-6)
- Place supporting statements strategically to enhance the primary message
- Ensure the main value proposition is immediately visible without scrolling

## Card Components
- Use rounded corners (rounded-3xl) for all cards
- Apply consistent shadow depth (shadow-sm) for subtle elevation
- Maintain uniform padding within cards (p-6)
- For case study cards, use two-column layout with dashboard mockups on desktop
- Dashboard mockups should follow the pattern documented in timeline-component-rule.mdc

## Accessibility
- Maintain proper color contrast for text readability
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Add appropriate alt text for images

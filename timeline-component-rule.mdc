# Timeline Component

The onboarding timeline visually walks prospects through our sevenâ€‘step process. Use it whenever a section needs to emphasise speed and clarity of execution.

## Layout
* Vertical line centred on desktop and aligned left on mobile
* Steps alternate left and right on larger screens
* Each step shows a **number**, **title**, short **description** and **duration**

## Animation
* Fade steps upward with Framer Motion using the `fadeUp` variant
* Animate the connecting line from top to bottom as the section enters view

## Style
* Gradient line from **Iris Purple** to **Mint Green**
* Step numbers use the gradient as text fill
* Card backgrounds follow the glass style: `bg-deep-navy/50` with `backdrop-blur-sm`
* Ensure at least AA contrast for text

## Dashboard Mockups
The dashboard screenshots in each step should be consistent:
* Rounded corners (`rounded-xl`) and thin border (`border-iris-purple/20`)
* Full width on mobile, 50% width on desktop
* Keep the same aspect ratio so the timeline feels uniform
